# Lens Distortion

The **Lens Distortion** effect distorts the final rendered picture to simulate the shape of a real-world camera lens.

## Using Lens Distortion

**Lens Distortion** uses the [Volume](Volumes.html) framework, so to enable and modify **Lens Distortion** properties, you must add a **Lens Distortion** override to a [Volume](Volumes.html) in your Scene. To add **Lens Distortion** to a Volume:

1. Select the Volume component in the Scene or Hierarchy to view it in the Inspector.
2. In the Inspector, navigate to **Add Override > Post-processing** and click on **Lens Distortion**. HDRP now applies **Lens Distortion** to any Camera this Volume affects.

| **Property**     | **Description**                                              |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Intensity**    | Use the slider to set the overall strength of the distortion effect. |
| **X Multiplier** | Use the slider to set the strength of the distortion effect on the x-axis. A value of 0 disables distortion on the x-axis. |
| **Y Multiplier** | Use the slider to set the strength of the distortion effect on the y-axis. A value of 0 disables distortion on the y-axis. |
| **Center**       | Set the center point of the distortion effect on the screen. |
| **Scale**        | Use the slider to set the value for global screen scaling. This zooms the render to hide the borders. When you use a high distortion, pixels on the screen borders can break because they rely on information from pixels outside the screen boundaries that don't exist. This property is useful for hiding these broken pixels around the screen border. |
